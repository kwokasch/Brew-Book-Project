"Brew Book App" - Front-End

"Brew Book" is a full-stack web application that allows users to generate an online review database for beers. The app utilizes the "BreweryDB" API to allow users to search for beers on the API. Users can also search the app's database to view beers, and can add beers to the database if they don't yet exist.
